Exercises from `Data Science from Scratch` First Editiion (2015) by Joel Grus.  
However, there is a second edition of the book where all the examples are updated to require at least Python 3.6. `https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch`

The initial checkin of the code is from 2016.  That was the first attempt and I think there was a second attempt during the intervening years between then and now.  It is a good time as any to finally go through this book and learn something.  So hopefully, the third time is a charm!
